Welcome to ResourceHub Launcher!

The ResourceHub Launcher is a easy and simple way to install mods for the Desktop Goose!

Looking for the backend? Check [this github repo](https://github.com/desktopgooseunofficial/launcher-backend). 

## FAQ:

### Why Archived?

The original creators of the mod installer for Desktop Goose lost interest in the project a long time ago. If somebody is still maintaining our launcher then you won't be able to see their work in this repository anyway.

### Where can I download final versions?

[1.3]([https://github.com/DesktopGooseUnofficial/launcher/releases](https://github.com/DesktopGooseUnofficial/launcher/releases/download/v1.3/ResourceHubLauncher.exe))

[Unfinished 2.0 beta](https://github.com/ResourceHubLauncher/nightly/releases/download/nightly-2/ResourceHubLauncher.exe)

### I have downloaded mods, but it doesn't work! Help!

Checklist:

- [x] Set EnableMods in config.ini from False to True
- [x] Unzip the mods, put them in a seperate folder for each of them and put the folders in the Mods folder
- [x] Restart the goose
- [x] Accept the warning

### Can I give the developers... money?

We would rather you giving the money to [Sam](https://patreon.com/sammakesvr) instead of us ‚ù§
